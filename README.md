This is a simple behavior add-on for Minecraft. It aims to make leather a more "sustainable" resource in Minecraft in the following ways.
- Leather equipment (armor, saddles) can be "smelted" into rabbit hides.
  - Finally a use for all those leather boots and saddles from fishing!
  - This reflects the diminished returns of smelting other components, e.g. Iron Armor into Iron Ingots.
- Saddles can be crafted from 6 leather. 
  - Saddles are somewhat difficult to find early game (when you need them) and abundant late game (when you don't). This is meant to balance that out a bit.

One stretch goal is to modify the textures for dyed leather armor, so that the helmet and leggings completely match the dyed color (instead of having brown patches).
